*********************
Release 0.8b (Merlin)
*********************

GENERAL
- Support for JDK 5.0 and eclipse 3.1
- Heavy refactoring to prepare the support of PDB files
  --> no more algorithm package
  --> comp2d and comp3d packages
  --> made easymol work on abstract types (removed instanceof calls)
  
CORE
- Added the CoreUtility class to contain helper functions for the core

GUI :
- Better support for save /load functions as well as better molecule naming
- Use of the plastic theme for the application

BUG FIXES
22 August 2005 : (CORE) fixed a bug that made an atom satisfied valency decrement when 
                 a bonding operation failed


**********************
Release 0.5b (Gandalf)
**********************

GENERAL
- Refactored program structure
  --> fr.emn.easymol.algorithms      : contains molecule analysis and processing algorithm
  --> fr.emn.easymol.algorithms.util : contains helper classes for the algorithms
  --> fr.emn.easymol.core            : contains the data model
  --> fr.emn.easymol.main            : contains top level windows for the program
  --> fr.emn.easymol.test            : contains JUnit test suite
  --> fr.emn.easymol.ui.actions      : contains action classes for the GUI
  --> fr.emn.easymol.ui.component    : contains GUI components

GUI :
- Complete rewrite of the GUI
- Used the jgraph component for the GUI (instead of owner drawn component)  

DATA MODEL :
- Rewrite of the molecule data model based on a composite pattern

ALGORITHMS :
- New 1D, 2D, 3D algorithms
- Mapping for the old 3D algorithm between the old (version 0.3) and the new structure 
  (wrapper/adapter pattern)
  
PERSISTANCE
- Added XML Support
  
BUG FIXES:
- Solved exception when rendering empty molecule

**********************
Release 0.3b (Saruman)
**********************

GUI:
- Removed the constants about window sizes when the size is dynamically fixed (e.g. size of the screen)
- Added a toolBar in the main window of EasyMol
- Completed and ensured that all the javadoc has no typo (at last! It was so boring and terrible!)
- Corrected a bug while removing an atom or a link (the molecule was set to modified even if the operation was not successful)
- Redesigned allSaveCloseQuit() in LibGUI because of undesired side effects -> management of Z-order is now correct
- Added filefiltering for XML files when loading and saving
- Finally added the auto enabling/disabling of actions when no VisuWin is opened -> it allowed to clean code by removing all the stuff that
	once did this kind of checking
- Rechanged the load feature so that it uses the fields of the VisuWin if there is one. Otherwise, implementing pathnames
	would have been a total waste of time as the window was closed hence the loss of the pathname...
- Corrected a bug when the "close all" was looping infinitely when the user choosed "cancel"
- Loading a molecule now closes the previous opened window
