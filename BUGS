GUI:
-when "save all" is pressed and the user choose "Yes" but then cancel his choice, the molecule is not saved
	and when the following window molecule is saved, a NullPointer is thrown.
	It seems the path of the molecule was not correctly set...
	Solution: redesign the save all and close all functions so that thet don't offer the cancel choice
